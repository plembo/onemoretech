# README for custom Ubuntu webapp launchers
This folder contains application shortcuts and icons for various "webapps" on Ubuntu Desktop, using Firefox browser.

When launched each app opens up in a new Firefox window with full "ornamentation" (i.e.: tabs, search window/address bar, bookmarks toolbar, etc.). Out of box, Firefox provides few opportunities to customize individual windows without using additional user profiles that add another layer of complexity. Given how often web app sessions involve launching a new browser tab or window (e.g., when a link is opened in an email), limiting the controls visible in a web app window for aethetic reasons is often an exercise in frustration.

## Instructions
* Copy .desktop files to ~/.local/share/applications 
* Copy icon files to ~/.local/share/icons

Use desktop environment of choice to add these icons to dock or application menu system.
